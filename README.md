# Consulting-Survey

The data set was taken from kaggle.com - Consulting_survey_Dataset.

The dataset created is based on people who filled a survey, and it tells if the person currently works at a consulting company; if yes, then which consulting firm it is. What is their current title, location, the compensation in USD, bonus, and how many hours do they work in a week? Moreover, it asks if they received an offer from any other consulting company this year. If yes, then the company's name, location, offered compensation, bonus, and if they accepted the offer or not.

The first step was to identify the inscope columns for our use. After which we cleaned the data for use. All of this can be found under the report - 'Consulting Report'. 
The cleaned and incope data file is named as 'Consulting Inscope Dataset'.
There's an ERD diagram explaining the relationship between the Employee, Future Company and Current Company.
At the end there's XML code files for a sample data set from the 'Consulting Inscope Dataset'.
